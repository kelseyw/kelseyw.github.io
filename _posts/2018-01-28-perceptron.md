This project was completed for my Start to Code with Swift course. For this project, I used Swift to create an iOS based game for iPad. In the game, players press a button to guess a letter. If the letter is in the word, it populates in one or more of the blank spaces. If the letter is not in the word, an apple disappears from the tree. The goal is to guess the word before all of the apples disappear. The design of this game involved a wide range of basic Swift skills, including the use of stack views, arrays, outlets, actions, structs, and methods.
